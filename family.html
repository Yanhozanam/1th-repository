<h4>My background</h4>

<p>
My family is the root of who I am. We may not have had everything, but we had enough: love, resilience, and the kind of strength that doesn't come from wealth ‚Äî it comes from unity <br>
Every lesson I've learned began at home. <br>From my parents,I inherited the value of hard work and faith. From my siblings, I learned to share, to laugh through struggle, and to keep going even when the odds are against <br>
They are my quiet strength ‚Äî the reason I strive for more. <br> Every success I aim for is not just for me, but for them. I want to build a future that honors their sacrifices and proves that where you start does not limit how far you can go.
